## SDSU UNRC HPC documentation

This github repository is a temporary home for documentation on some
of the [high performance
computing](https://www.sdstate.edu/information-technology/hpc-cluster-computing)
systems and services provided by the [University Networking and
Research
Computing](https://www.sdstate.edu/information-technology/university-networking-and-research-computing),
within [Information
Technology](https://www.sdstate.edu/information-technology) at [South
Dakota State University](https://www.sdstate.edu).

Previously, our most recent documentation was available in pdf form in
a shared folder on
[Box.com](https://sdsu.app.box.com/s/aet477q974ad872vz4v7v24jq5vxer6u),
(https://goo.gl/a8Z5MU).  The topics relate mainly to the Linux
cluster (`blackjack/bigjack`) but also some of the other Linux servers
(`silvertip2`,`silvertip3`, etc.) and related issues/services.

[Linux Command Line](linux_command_line/linux_cmd.md) General information about using the command line interface on Linux systems. 

[Command Line Connection](CLI-Instructions.md) How to connect to a remote Linux server, using, for example the Windows PuTTY program, or the Terminal program on a Mac.
