## "Roaring Thunder" Linux Cluster

In fall of 2018, the new SDSU Linux cluster, "thunder", became operational and is now in testing mode.  They system is housed in the Admin building (Morrill hall) data center and consists of 56 compute nodes, 5 big memory nodes, 4 gpu nodes, and 450 TB GPFS parallel file system.

## Quickstart

Documentation is currently being developed for the system.  The basics of getting connected and running a simple job are outlined here.

### Accounts

To gain access to the cluster, for now use the existing "form"
at https://www.sdstate.edu/information-technology/connecting-cluster, and put in `thunder` for the research server name.  Email the form to SDSU.HPC@sdstate.edu; CC to brian.moore@sdstate.edu and chad.julius@sdstate.edu.

### Login

The login node of the cluster is `roaringthunder.sdstate.edu`; you can also use the shorter name `rt.sdstate.edu`.  Use a terminal program (e.g. PuTTY) to make a command line connection to the login node.  When you first log in for the first time, you should see notification that a folder has been automatically created for you in the `/home` area.

### Campus Active Directory credentials

Your username and password for the system will be your current SDSU campus username and password (for example username `brian.moore`, etc.).  Use your SDSU FacStaff account if you have one--check with Support Desk if you are not sure.

If you only have a student account, your username will be the "short" version, usually one string in the pattern: first initial, middle initial, last name (for example `cajulius`).

Email us if you are having login problems after being notified of account creation:
SDSU.HPC@sdstate.edu, CC to brian.moore@sdstate.edu and chad.julius@sdstate.edu.
